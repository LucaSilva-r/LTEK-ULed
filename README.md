## What is this project?

**LucaLights** tries to lower the cost and complexity of lighting setups in StepMania and it's forks (Like ITGMania). **How?** by using **WLED** of course! By using wled (through the DDP protocol) you can use whatever LED Bulb and Light Strip you already have and adding more is as easy as buying one of the many controllers already available.
